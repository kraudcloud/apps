    Meilisearch is a RESTful search API.
    It aims to be a ready-to-go solution for everyone who wants a fast and relevant search experience for their end-users ‚ö°Ô∏èüîé

    Efficient search engines often require a significant investment of resources. They are only accessible to companies with the means necessary to develop a bespoke search solution that fits their needs.

    Small-to-medium-sized businesses commonly resort to subpar search engines that incur invisible costs on their user experience and retention due to poor search fulfillment.

    That's why we created Meilisearch: An open source solution accessible to everyone, designed to meet a vast majority of needs. Requiring very little configuration to be installed, yet highly customizable.

    Our solution delivers an instant search experience including typo handling, filters, custom rankings, and many more features. Read on to learn more.
